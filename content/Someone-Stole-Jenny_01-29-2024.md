## Someone Stole Landon's Car

Nobody expected it... The long-awaited sequel to somebody stealing my bike... 

Somebody stole Landon's car.

I never had a car in college. In fact, I didn't even know how to drive until a few months ago. So, during the two years at UCLA where I lived with Landon, we drove around in his car Jenny. He got Jenny in high school and she had traveled with him from Arizona to Los Angeles to San Fransisco.

Her demise in San Fransisco is, of course, not surprising. Nonetheless, it is heartbreaking. Landon was planning on selling Jenny and getting a new car at some point this year. He was mentally preparing to say goodbye to an old friend. Imagine that. You think you've got a few more months, but they're literally stolen away from you. 

I'll miss Jenny. She didn't drive smooth, but she did drive fast. We did a road trip down the west coast with her a few months ago. Having just got my license, I did some reasonably long stretches of driving. Jenny is probably the car I've driven most in my licensed life.

Unlike my bike, we did find out what happened to Jenny. She was totaled. What a sad way to go for that magisterial beast.
