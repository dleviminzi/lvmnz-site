## Someone Stole My Bike
I had been expecting someone to steal it for a while now. I didn't have a great lock on it. My bike was old, kind of rusty, and very ugly. I figured that most thieves would not bother making the effort, but that one day the right thief would come along.

My bike was about 15 years old. It had been my dad's bike. He gave it to me when I moved back to New York after college.

My favorite part of my bike was that every once in a while the chain would fall off and I would eat shit. One time it happened while I was going particularly fast around a corner in riverside park. I must've flown five feet. I reset the chain and biked home with my hands covered in grease and blood. Inconvenient (and at times painful) quirks like this have a tendency to make objects feel more unique and somehow alive. I like to think my bike was like a horse rejecting its rider. Maybe I spurred it too hard.
